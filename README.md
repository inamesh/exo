This is an open source project and I welcome contributions to make it better, faster or prettier!

## Background
In the 3rd week of March 2020, movement restrictions were imposed in Greece due to the rapid spread of coronavirus. 

All residents of Greece are required to send a message to the number 13033 (free of charge) with a reason code followed by their name and address before leaving their place of residence.

### Functionality

The web app displays all the reasons and allows user to compose an SMS on both iOS and Android devices.
The app also remembers the user's name and address so that they do not have to enter it again.

### Official Source

Official process and reason codes can be found on <a href="https://forma.gov.gr/#sms" target="_blank">forma.gov.gr</a>

### Contribute
I will accept pull requests, just make sure you include a summary and screenshots (if necessary).

## Credits
